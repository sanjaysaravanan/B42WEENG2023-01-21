  what if a particular property is specified in all three CSS ways
  
  Priority:
    Default Priority:
      inline > line of execution ( internal or enternal ( which get executed the last takes over the priority ) ) of styles

  Overwrite the Default:
    use of important ---> overrride the default priority order.
    
  class vs id:
    id CSS Selector:
      use #<id-name> to select a specific tag/tags
      
      #para-one {
        color: green;
      }
      
      eg: <p id="para-one" >This is para</p>

      Each Tag should have unique id ( only one id for a tag is possible )
    
    Class:
      use .<class-name> to select a grp of tag
      
      .color-green {
        color: green;
      }
      
      .bg-yellow {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
      
      eg: <p class="color-green bg-yellow" >This is para</p>
          <p class="color-green bg-yellow" >This is para Two</p>

      multiple elements can have same class
    
    Priorities
      id & class 
      If more than one rule applies to an element and specifies the same property, then CSS gives priority to the rule that has the more specific selector. An ID selector is more specific than a class selector, which in turn is more specific than a tag selector.

    multiple classes
      A tag/element can have muliple classes eg: class="class-one bg-green"

    
  
  display property: 
    inline -> takes only the required width, even if width is specified
    block -> occupies the entire width of the parent
    inline-block -> acts like inline, untill the width is specified ( takes the specified width )

  Box Model:
    wrapping the contents of an element with padding, border, margin

    inside to outside 
      content ---> padding ---> border ---> margin 

    outside to inside
      margin ---> border ---> padding ---> content
    
    margin:
      outermost layer of Box Model

    padding:
      innermost layer near to the content

    border: middle layer

  Parent Inherit:
    Inheriting the parent CSS properties from child elements/tags
    eg: border: inherit; // takes parent value if any else default
  
  css function:
    url() --> takes a path for the image or someother
    linear-gradient() --> 
    calc() --> calculate the property value from arthimetic operation (-, +)
    eg: width: calc(100px - 30px) ---> 70px
        parent entire height is 1000px 
        height: calc(100% - 50px) ---> 950px

  gradient:
    linear-gradient --> function which mixes color is the desired percentage

  meta tags:
    xtra information about the site which helps in seo ( search engine optimization, encoding, browser compatability, viewport management )
    eg: <meta name="description" content="some description" />
        <meta name="keywords" content="searchable keywords" /> used of SEO

        <meta charset="utf-8" /> char encoding format
        <meta http-equiv="utf-8" /> legacy browser 
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=<value>, initial-scale=1" /> controlling the viewport for the user

          containing block (html tag) ** if provided none of its parents has non 
          static position value**
        ** When some of its parents has non static position value then it moves with 
        respective to the closest positioned parent **
